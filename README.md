# gulp-webapp-1

I created this app using the Yeoman [generator-gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp)

It fires up and works perfectly from the command line or even directly from Sublime Text 3.

I followed these steps for [Deploying to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp/blob/master/docs/recipes/gh-pages.md)
